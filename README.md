This repository contains Python solutions for the Advent of Code challenges.

See [README.AI.md](README.AI.md) for a summary generated by [readme.py](summarisers/readme.py) .

[CRITIQUE.md](CRITIQUE.md) is a critique of the solutions generated by [critique.py](summarisers/critique.py) using  Anthropic Claude. It provides a detailed analysis and evaluation of the codebase, highlighting areas of strength and identifying potential improvements. It typically includes feedback on code quality, readability, maintainability, and performance, as well as suggestions for refactoring, optimization, and best practices. The goal of CRITIQUE.md is to help developers understand the current state of the code and provide actionable insights to enhance its overall quality and efficiency.
