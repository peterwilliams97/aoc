# HOW TO EVALUATE PROGRAMMING CODE

Yyou must evaluate programming code based on the following criteria:

## GOOD PROGRAMMING CRITERIA

**9 Best Programming Practices in Python**

As a Python programming judge for Advent of Code (AoC) solutions, here are the top 10 criteria I
look for when evaluating programs, rated on a scale of 1 to 10:

---

### **1. Correctness (Mandatory)**
- **What I Look For:** The solution produces the correct results for both the example inputs and the
provided inputs.
- **High Score Criteria:** Handles all edge cases and doesn't rely on assumptions not supported by
the problem description.

---

### **2. Problem Solving Approach**
- **What I Look For:** The thought process behind solving the problem is sound, creative, and
demonstrates understanding.
- **High Score Criteria:** Employs novel techniques or leverages mathematical insights to simplify
the solution,

---

### **3. Efficiency**
- **What I Look For:** The program executes efficiently, particularly for large or complex inputs.
- **High Score Criteria:** Optimized algorithms (e.g., avoiding \(O(n^2)\) where \(O(n \log n)\) is
possible), appropriate use of data structures, and minimal memory overhead.


### **4. Readability**
- **What I Look For:** Code is well-structured and easy to read.
- **High Score Criteria:** Clear variable names, proper spacing, and logical organization. Avoids
excessive nesting and clutter.

---

### **5. Conciseness**
- **What I Look For:** The solution avoids unnecessary verbosity while remaining clear.
- **High Score Criteria:** Uses Pythonic idioms (e.g., list comprehensions, `zip`, `enumerate`)
effectively without sacrificing readability.

---

### **6. Modularity**
- **What I Look For:** The solution breaks the problem into functions or classes that encapsulate
distinct parts of the problem.
- **High Score Criteria:** Functions are well-named, reusable, and focus on a single responsibility.


---

### **7. Robustness**
- **What I Look For:** The program handles edge cases, invalid inputs (if applicable), and adheres
to the problem constraints.
- **High Score Criteria:** Includes checks, error handling, and safeguards for potential pitfalls.


---

### **8. Documentation and Comments**
- **What I Look For:** Meaningful comments and documentation that explain the code's logic and
purpose.
- **High Score Criteria:** Includes docstrings for functions and comments where necessary but avoids
over-commenting obvious parts.

---

### **9. Innovation and Elegance**
- **What I Look For:** Unique approaches that go beyond a straightforward implementation.
- **High Score Criteria:** Solutions that are not only correct and efficient but also exhibit
creativity or elegance in their design.

---

**Bonus Criteria:**
- **Test Cases:** Inclusion of automated tests or scripts that verify the correctness of the solution.
- **Performance Benchmarking:** Any steps to analyze and improve runtime efficiency.

By scoring each criterion on a 1–10 scale, I aim to provide a holistic evaluation of the solution
that balances correctness, problem-solving skill, and Python programming expertise.

## BAD PROGRAMMING CRITERIA

**10 Worst Programming Practices in Python**


Here are the 10 factors that lead to low ratings for Python programs, ordered from worst to least
worst in terms of programming impact:

### **1. Incorrectness**
- **Why It's the Worst:** The program fails to produce the correct output for the provided examples
or problem inputs. This is a critical failure, as correctness is non-negotiable.
- **Examples:** Produces wrong results, misses edge cases, or makes assumptions not supported by the
problem description.

---

### **2. Poor Efficiency (Extremely Slow)**
- **Why It's Bad:** The solution is so inefficient that it fails to complete for larger inputs
 within a reasonable timeframe.
- **Examples:** Using \(O(n^3)\) algorithms when \(O(n \log n)\) solutions exist, unnecessary brute
force, or lack of optimization for known constraints.

---

### **3. Lack of Structure (Spaghetti Code)**
- **Why It's Bad:** The program lacks logical structure, making it hard to follow or modify.
- **Examples:** Everything is written in a single, monolithic block with no functions or reusable
components.

---

### **4. Hard-to-Read Code**
- **Why It's Bad:** Code readability is crucial for understanding, debugging, and maintaining.
- **Examples:** Poor variable names (`x1`, `var`, `tmp`), inconsistent indentation, or overly
complex one-liners.

---

### **5. Overcomplication**
- **Why It's Bad:** The solution is unnecessarily complex, making it harder to understand or debug.
- **Examples:** Using an overly elaborate algorithm for a simple problem, or solving a problem with
excessive nested loops or recursion.

---

### **6. Reinventing the Wheel**
- **Why It's Bad:** Failing to use built-in Python features or libraries leads to inefficient and
error-prone code.
- **Examples:** Manually implementing sorting, prime checking, or other basic functionalities that
 are already part of Python's standard library.

---

### **7. Lack of Error Handling or Robustness**
- **Why It's Bad:** Programs that break on edge cases or invalid inputs demonstrate poor
consideration for robustness.
- **Examples:** Index out of range, unhandled exceptions, or assuming inputs will always meet the
problem's description.

---

### **8. Over-Commenting or No Comments**
- **Why It's Bad:** Comments that are either absent or excessive detract from clarity.
- **Examples:** No explanation of non-obvious logic, or comments that simply restate the code
(`# Increment x by 1 -> x += 1`).

---

### **9. Excessive Verbosity**
- **Why It's Bad:** Solutions that are unnecessarily long or redundant indicate inefficiency and
poor problem-solving skills.
- **Examples:** Repeating the same logic multiple times instead of using loops, or verbose
implementations of simple tasks.

---

### **10. Lack of Testing**
- **Why It's Bad:** Failing to verify correctness through example and edge-case testing reduces
confidence in the solution.
- **Examples:** Not testing with provided examples, hardcoding outputs, or omitting tests for edge
cases like empty inputs.

---

These factors cumulatively lead to lower ratings, with a focus on correctness, efficiency, and
clarity as the most critical aspects.


## ADDITIONAL NOTES

**10 Programming Practices That Don't Directly Affect Ratings**

Here are 10 programming practices that many programmers value but don't directly affect my ratings
as an Advent of Code (AoC) judge. While they are important in general software development, they are
less critical in the context of AoC solutions:

---

### **1. Code Formatting Standards (e.g., PEP 8 Compliance)**
- **Why It Doesn't Affect Ratings:** As long as the code is readable, minor deviations from
formatting standards (like line length or spacing) don't impact functionality or problem-solving.

---

### **2. Use of Type Hints**
- **Why It Doesn't Affect Ratings:** While type hints improve maintainability in larger projects,
 their absence in a small AoC script doesn’t hinder the solution's correctness or efficiency.

---

### **3. Test Automation**
- **Why It Doesn't Affect Ratings:** Writing a formal test suite is valuable in real-world projects
but isn't essential for AoC solutions, where correctness is often validated by running examples
manually.

---

### **4. Adherence to Object-Oriented Design**
- **Why It Doesn't Affect Ratings:** AoC problems rarely require complex systems or classes, so
following OOP principles (e.g., encapsulation, inheritance) is often unnecessary.

---

### **5. Scalability Beyond the Problem Constraints**
- **Why It Doesn't Affect Ratings:** AoC problems typically come with fixed input constraints, so
ensuring scalability for inputs beyond those constraints isn't required.

---

### **6. Code Reusability**
- **Why It Doesn't Affect Ratings:** AoC solutions are often one-off scripts, so writing reusable
code or libraries is not a priority for these challenges.

---

### **7. Adherence to Functional Programming Principles**
- **Why It Doesn't Affect Ratings:** While functional programming (e.g., avoiding side effects,
using pure functions) is elegant, it isn't strictly necessary to solve AoC problems effectively.

---

### **8. Use of Advanced Debugging Tools**
- **Why It Doesn't Affect Ratings:** Debugging practices like using a debugger or extensive logging
are useful but not relevant if the final solution works as intended.

---

### **9. Performance Optimizations Beyond Problem Constraints**
- **Why It Doesn't Affect Ratings:** Over-optimizing for hypothetical edge cases (e.g., inputs
larger than the problem specifies) is unnecessary since AoC problems are bounded by their constraints.

---

### **10. Following Agile or Development Workflows**
- **Why It Doesn't Affect Ratings:** Practices like iterative development, version control, or pair
programming are excellent in team environments but irrelevant for evaluating a standalone AoC
solution.

---

**Summary:**
These practices are valuable in professional or large-scale projects but are often unnecessary in
the context of AoC solutions. My ratings focus on correctness, problem-solving skills, and Python
 proficiency rather than adherence to generalized software engineering principles.
